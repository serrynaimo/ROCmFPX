# Jev-style decision classifier in llama-server

llama-server can answer typed questions about a text with calibrated probabilities instead of generated text:
the TypeSafe *System One* API made popular by Jev, served by an open decision model such as
[StartLux-Decision](https://huggingface.co/startlux-models), Wald or [TinyJev](https://github.com/ankit-aglawe/tinyjev).

```
POST /v1/classifier            (alias: /v1/systemone)

   "author": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Who most likely wrote this?",
              "criteria": {"pirate": "A pirate", "grandma": "A grandmother", "robot": "A robot"}},
   "sea":    {"type": "noul",   "instructions": "Does the text mention the sea, ships or water?"},
   "chaos":  {"type": "score",  "instructions": "How chaotic is this?", "criteria": ["calm", "mild", "wild"]}}}

    "answers": {"author": {"type": "choice", "choice": "pirate", "confidence": 0.6,
                           "probabilities": {"pirate": 0.735, "grandma": 0.118, "robot": 0.147}},
                "sea":    {"type": "noul", "noul": 0.0374},
                "chaos":  {"type": "score", "score": 1.9, "legend": {"0": "calm", "1": "mild", "2": "wild"},

```

The routes sit behind the normal API key check. State, instructions and option descriptions may be strings, numbers,
lists or objects. The classifier is the model loaded with `-m`, on any backend; for pure CPU use `-dev none -ngl 0`
(without `-dev none` llama.cpp may still offload large matmuls to a GPU). Two model families are served, chosen by
`"family"` in `--classifier-config FILE`.

## Letter family (no head)

Most current decision models (StartLux-Decision, Wald, decider, TinyJev v2): the options are lettered in a text
prompt and the answer is the model's next-token logits of those letters.

```
llama-server -m StartLux-Decision-2B-BF16.gguf --classifier-config classifier.json -dev none -ngl 0 -c 4096
```

```json
{"name": "startlux-decision-2b", "family": "letter",
 "letter": {
   "prompt": "<|im_start|>system\nApply the criterion to the evidence. Choose exactly one listed option. Answer with its letter only.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nEvidence:\n{state}\n\nQuestion: {instructions}\nOptions:{options}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n",
   "empty_state": "(none)", "option_line": "\n{letter}) {text}", "variants": ["{letter}"],
   "state_format": "json", "json_index_min": 8, "score_format": "{name}: {desc}", "true_first": true,
   "noul_instructions": "Which answer fits the evidence?", "bare_keys": "bare", "same_as_name": true, "strip": true,
   "temperature": {"noul": 2.2907, "choice": 1.5319, "score": 1.6163}}}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | the whole prompt of one question; `{state}` may appear twice. Special tokens written here (a chat template) are parsed, user text is escaped |
| `prompt_no_state`, `empty_state` | for a blank state: another prompt, or the text that stands in for the state |
| `option_line` | one option, `{letter}` is A, B, .. |
| `variants` | token spellings of a letter whose probabilities are added |
| `state_format` | `text` (labelled lines) or `json` (compact JSON; `json_index_min` adds `_index` to the items of long arrays) |
| `score_format`, `true_first`, `noul_instructions`, `same_as_name`, `strip` | how levels and yes/no are written |
| `bare_keys` | choice keys that only number the options: `positional` drops a leading `a: `, `bare` shows the description alone |
| `temperature` | a number, or a map looked up as `<type>\|<bucket>` (option count 2, 3-4, 5-8, 9+), `<type>`, `default` |
| `style` | `ollama` (TinyJev v2): the options become the user message of Ollama's decision API, which `prompt` wraps as `{user}` |

The questions of a request share their common token prefix (the state): it is decoded once and each question
continues from a restored copy. More than 26 options are read in chunks whose winners meet in a final read.

## Pointer family (with a head)

TinyJev v1, Kev: add `--classifier-head FILE`, a safetensors file with `q.weight`, `q.bias`, `k.weight`, `k.bias`.
A `tinyjev.json` manifest works as the config; every key is optional:

```json
{"name": "tinyjev-4b", "family": "pointer",
 "head": {"head_dim": 256, "temperature": 1.0},
 "max_state": 8192, "max_branch": 8192, "max_options": 255,
 "layout": {
   "tokens": {"state": "<|fim_prefix|>", "question": "<|fim_middle|>", "option": "<|box_start|>",
              "close": "<|box_end|>", "decide": "<|fim_suffix|>"},
   "escape_special": true, "option_format": "{name}: {desc}",
   "boolean_labels": {"false": "no", "true": "yes"}}}
```

The prompt is `<state> text <question> instructions (<option> option <close>)* <decide>`, and the head scores the
hidden state at `<decide>` against the one at each `<close>`. With `escape_special`, `<|name|>` in user text becomes
`<¦name¦>` so it cannot forge a delimiter.

## Answer cache

`--classifier-cache DIR` keeps answers on disk: an answer depends only on the model, head and config files and on
the tokens of the state and the question, so a repeated question about the same state is answered without a decode.
Caching is per question; the response carries `"cached": true` when nothing had to be decoded. Changing the model,
head or config starts a new file; a file over 64 MiB loses its older half at the next start.

## Recommended model

For a classifier that runs on the CPU next to a chat model: StartLux-Decision-2B, and on AMD Ryzen CPUs its **BF16**
file rather than Q8_0. Ryzen 9 7900, 12 threads, OpenDecision 500 and 115 requests of our own:

| Model | Family | OpenDecision 500 | Own requests | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TinyJev-4B v1 | pointer | 476 | 105 | 0.86 - 0.89 s |
| **StartLux-Decision-2B** | letter | 486 | 110 | 0.57 - 0.72 s |
| Wald-4B v1.2 | letter | 488 | 111 | 1.1 - 1.25 s |
| TinyJev-4B v2 | letter, `ollama` | 490 | 110 | 1.9 s |

BF16 against Q8_0 for StartLux-Decision-2B: a yes/no question 0.39 s against 0.75 s, a 21-option choice 1.05 s
against 2.0 s, at 3.8 GB against 2.0 GB. Its probabilities are cautious (the shipped temperatures flatten them), and
the weights are CC BY-NC 4.0; Wald-4B is the Apache-2.0 alternative.

## Router mode

One public port for chat and classifier models: the router starts each model as a child from a `--models-preset`
INI and routes by the request's `"model"` (name or alias). Classifier routes whose `"model"` is missing or unknown go
to the first model with `classifier-head` or `classifier-config` in its preset; `--models-default NAME` sends other
requests without a known `"model"` to NAME, like a single-model server.

```ini
version = 1

[qwen/qwen3.8-27b]
model = Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27B-ROCMFPX-MQ-Q4S.gguf
load-on-startup = true
gpu-keepalive-ms = 2000

[startlux-decision-2b]
model = StartLux-Decision-2B-BF16.gguf
classifier-config = classifier.json
load-on-startup = true
dev = none
ngl = 0
```

```
llama-server --models-preset models.ini --models-max 0 --models-default qwen/qwen3.8-27b --port 1234
```

`--models-api-loopback-only` keeps model management (load, unload, download, delete) to loopback clients, so the API
key can be shared with outside callers. `--gpu-keepalive-ms N` touches a small buffer on each used GPU every N ms:
some Windows drivers evict an idle GPU's VRAM to system RAM once it has no display work.
