# Qwen3.8-27B for agents on a Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX

A `llama-server` runtime for **Qwen3.8-27B with 80k context on a 20 GB
RX 7900 XT** (more on the 24 GB XTX), built for **agentic work**: long
tool-calling sessions, several agents sharing one GPU, and clients that rewrite
their own history. It is [ROCmFPX](#rocmfpx-llamacpp) (ROCm/HIP, ROCmFP4
weights) plus a server-side prompt cache on SSD.

## What it does well

- **A 27B model with 80k context on a 20 GB card.** ROCmFP4 weights (~15 GB)
  and a q4_0 KV cache: 18.9 GB at load.
- **Fast decode.** The model's own MTP head drafts four tokens ahead: 54 t/s
  on prose against 35 t/s without it, and 51 t/s with 41k tokens of history.
- **Switching conversations costs seconds, not minutes.** Qwen3.8 is a hybrid
  (16 attention + 49 recurrent layers), and recurrent state cannot be rolled
  back to an arbitrary prefix, so stock llama.cpp re-prefills a conversation
  from scratch once another request has taken the slot. Here the conversation
  is written to SSD together with its checkpoints and restored when it returns:

  | situation | stock | this runtime, median (range) |
  |---|---|---|
  | return to a 40-53k-token conversation after another agent used the slot | 77-105 s | **2.9 s** (1.5-7.3) |
  | new session with the same 12-24k system prompt + tools | 20-42 s | **0.7 s** (0.4-25) |
  | prompt diverges from the cached one before its end, 25-34k | 45-62 s | 7.5 s (6.5-10) |
  | first request after a server restart, 18-27k | 30-50 s | 4.2 s (1.0-10.9) |

- **Two slots on one shared KV pool.** An orchestrator's chat turn no longer
  waits behind a worker's long run. A request starts beside a running one only
  when both keep 12k tokens of generation room, otherwise it queues; a
  conversation that has to give up its cells is saved to SSD first, so nothing
  is lost when the pool fills. More agents than slots is what the cache is for.
- **An idle conversation costs the active one nothing.** Each slot keeps its
  cells in its own range of the pool and attention runs over that range only.
  Stock llama.cpp computes attention over every occupied cell of a shared
  cache, so a 41k-token conversation resting in one slot cut the other slot's
  decode from 48 to 31 t/s and its prefill from 611 to 369 t/s. Here both stay
  at 48 and 608.
- **Shared system prompts.** States are saved every 4096 tokens inside the
  system prompt + tools block and at its end. Any conversation that starts with
  the same tokens resumes from the deepest state it still shares.
- **Survives restarts.** Cache entries left by a previous run are adopted.
- **Vision** through the f16 `mmproj`, including after a cache restore.
- **A decision classifier on the same port**: typed yes/no, choice and score
  answers with calibrated probabilities, from a small model on the CPU.
- **Fails fast when busy.** `LLAMA_MAX_QUEUED=n` rejects requests once `n` are
  already waiting, so a client can fall back to another server.

Measured on one machine: RX 7900 XT 20 GB, Ryzen 9 7900, 32 GB RAM,
Windows 11, ROCm 7.2 HIP SDK, one NVMe for models and cache. Nothing here has
been measured on an XTX.

## Quick start

**1. Model.** `Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27B-ROCMFPX-MQ-Q4S` (~15 GB): ROCmFP4
weights and the MTP head, with 61 sensitive tensors promoted to
`Q6_0_ROCMFPX`, plus the f16 `mmproj` for vision. The
[recipe and its tensor policy file](docs/rocmfpx/swift-1.5-qwen3.8-27b-mq-q4s.md)
are in this repository.

**2. Build** (ROCm 7.2 clang, Ninja; about 3 minutes):

```

```

The server speaks the usual OpenAI-compatible API on `/v1`.

| setting | why |
|---|---|
| `-c 81920`, q4_0 KV | about what a 20 GB card holds; KV costs ~18 KB/token. Whatever does not fit, Windows silently pages to system RAM. We run `-c 106496` in production: 18.9 GB resident, 0.8 GB paged. |
| `-np 2 --kv-unified --kv-unified-reserve 12288` | two slots share one pool instead of splitting it. The reserve admits a second request only while both can still generate 12k tokens, else it waits in the queue; idle slots are saved to the cache before their cells are taken. Without it a full pool fails both requests and wipes both contexts. Each slot's cells stay in its own range of the pool (with more slots, two per region), so attention covers the active conversation only. |
| `--no-cache-idle-slots` | keeps the idle conversation resident; the default saves and clears it at every new task, which leaves one live conversation. |
| `--no-mmproj-offload` | the 0.9 GB vision projector was the whole paged share at two slots. Images cost 7-12 s to the first token instead of 3-5 s. |
| `-ub 1024` | prefill +6% at 17k and +11% at 41k over 256, for 0.3 GB more paged memory; 512 gives +4% and +8% for 0.1 GB. Decode does not change with it (55.7 against 56.0 t/s on identical text). |
| MTP draft, `n-max 4` | +55% decode on prose, for 1.4 GB of VRAM and 3% of prefill speed. The draft head has its own KV cache; for prompt tokens only its K and V are computed, nothing else of the block is ever read. |
| `ROCMFPX_DRAFT_VOCAB=16384` | a drafted token is scored against 16,384 candidate tokens instead of all 248,320: half fixed, half the main model's own top tokens at the previous position, per slot. 0.12 ms instead of 1.9 ms per drafted token; the main model still verifies each one against the full vocabulary. Decode +9% on a short context, +3 to 5% at 41k. A verbatim copy drafts slightly less (acceptance 0.99 to 0.96), ordinary text the same. |
| `--ctx-checkpoints 8` | kept in host RAM, ~200 MiB each. When the list is full, the one whose removal leaves the smallest gap is dropped; the one at the first user message never is. |
| `--load-mode dio` | the default memory-mapped load keeps the 15 GB model file in system RAM. |
| `--gpu-keepalive-ms 2000` | an idle card on a nearly full VRAM budget loses its resident memory and the next request crawls. |
| `--reasoning-preserve` | with a client that does not echo thinking, every past assistant turn renders as an empty think block (~4 tokens). Without it the template renders the previous turn differently once a new user message arrives, so a tool-using turn was re-prefilled (median 5k tokens) on every exchange. |
| `GGML_CUDA_NO_PINNED=1` | pinned host memory makes more of the model page out, for no speed gain. |
| `--temp 1` | Qwen3.8 degrades under greedy decoding. |

## Speed

Measured on 9 October 2026 at the production shape (`-c 106496`, two slots,
`-ub 1024`, vision projector on the CPU, draft vocabulary 16384), at
temperature 0.

| decode t/s | |
|---|---:|
| prose, short context (three 450-token runs) | 53.8 |
| the 260-token answer to a cold 17k prompt | 53.4 |
| at 41k depth (three 300-token turns) | 50.7 |
| verbatim copy of a passage at 41k | 73.1 |
| without MTP, short context | 34.6 |

Code decodes faster than prose because more of the draft is accepted: nine
450-token runs gave 64.1 t/s (peak 73.4) that morning, before the three decode
changes listed below.

| cold prompt | 17k | 41k |
|---|---:|---:|
| prefill t/s, average over the prompt | 679 | 621 |
| the same without the MTP draft | 701 | 640 |

What moved prefill that day, same two prompts:

| cold prefill t/s | 17k | 41k |
|---|---:|---:|
| `-ub 256` | 612 | 528 |
| `-ub 1024` | 649 | 589 |
| `-ub 1024`, draft catch-up stores K and V only | 679 | 621 |

The catch-up change is exact: a fixed four-turn conversation at temperature 0
gives the same text and the same drafted and accepted token counts before and
after. It also runs after every verified batch during decode, which made those
four turns 2 to 5% faster (44.1 / 52.5 / 55.9 / 45.8 t/s before, 45.2 / 54.0 /
58.6 / 46.7 after).

What moved decode that evening, each step on top of the one above:

| decode t/s | prose, short context | at 41k depth | verbatim copy at 41k |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `-ub 1024`, draft catch-up stores K and V only | 46.2 | 41.6 | 57.1 |
| attention reads the q4_0 cache directly | 48.9 | 47.8 | 69.4 |
| one graph arena per verify-batch size | 49.5 | 49.2 | 69.4 |
| draft scores 16,384 candidate tokens | 53.8 | 50.7 | 73.1 |

Attention: a batch of one to eight tokens on a q4_0 cache went to a kernel 1.6
to 2.3 times slower than the tile kernel is on f16. The tile kernel now expands
the 4-bit blocks itself. Same values, different rounding order, so a near-tie
can resolve differently at temperature 0.

Draft: every drafted token was scored against all 248,320 rows of the output
layer, 1 GB of weights and 1.9 ms. It now scores 16,384 candidates in 0.12 ms.
The main model still verifies each drafted token against the full vocabulary,
so a missing candidate costs a rejected guess, never a wrong token. Acceptance
on ordinary text did not move (0.63 to 0.64); on the verbatim copy it fell from
0.99 to 0.96. The text of the 41k column differs between the last two rows
(the draft pattern decides which near-ties win), the copy column is the same
text in every row.

Where decode time goes: a pass reads the 15 GB of weights once, whatever the
number of tokens in it. With one to three tokens the ROCmFP4 kernel moves
700-740 GB/s, which is the memory bandwidth of the card (f16 weights reach
749). A verify pass over 3.5 tokens therefore takes 36 ms against 29 ms for a
single token, and that is what the draft buys. With five tokens the kernel
becomes compute-bound (545 GB/s), and so are the Q6 tensors at any width.

Where prefill time goes: at 17k about 85% is the ROCmFP4 matmul, which runs at
38-43 TFLOPS on the model's shapes. rocBLAS reaches 46-60 with f16 weights on
the same shapes and stock Q4_0 47-54, so the kernel is within a quarter of
what this card does at all. The rest is attention (17.6 us per token and layer
at 16k of history, growing with depth) and 3% for the recurrent layers.

Production traffic, 2-6 October 2026 (718 agent requests at `-c 106496`,
before the changes above), by context depth; requests generating 200+ tokens
(decode) or evaluating 1,500+ (prefill). The cache table at the top comes from
the same log, with "stock" being a cold prefill at these speeds.

| context depth | decode median | decode peak | prefill median | prefill peak |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| under 8k | 63.5 | 70.3 | 333 | 451 |
| 8-20k | 47.1 | 67.0 | 536 | 608 |
| 20-40k | 43.4 | 66.3 | 495 | 571 |
| 40-60k | 41.5 | 51.9 | 414 | 465 |
| 60-80k | 33.3 | 40.2 | 420 | 436 |
| all | 43.7 | 70.3 | 500 | 608 |

The slope is attention over the growing KV cache; the recurrent layers cost
the same at any depth. The first and last rows rest on 3-14 requests each.

Two slots, one of them idle with a 41k-token conversation in it. Stock
llama.cpp computes attention over every occupied cell of the shared cache; here
each slot attends to its own range (measured at `-ub 256`, before the decode
changes above):

| the active slot | other slot empty | stock, other slot holds 41k | this runtime, other slot holds 41k |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| shallow decode t/s | 48 | 31 | 49 |
| cold 17k prefill t/s | 611 | 369 | 608 |
| decode t/s at 17k depth | 50 | 36 | 51 |

Two slots working at the same moment share the GPU, not its speed: both
decoding gives 26 to 28 t/s each (one alone: 55), and a slot decoding while the
other prefills a cold 17k prompt gets about 10 t/s until that prefill is done.
Both conversations stay warm.

## The SSD prompt cache

Off unless `--cache-disk` is given. Everything else has a working default.

| flag | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--cache-disk PATH` | off | cache directory. Put it on an NVMe. |
| `--cache-disk-limit N` | 8192 | size limit in MiB; least recently used entries go first. A 16k-token entry is ~0.65 GB with one checkpoint, a 45k-token one ~1.8 GB with four. |
| `--cache-disk-checkpoints N` | -1 (all) | checkpoints written with each entry, newest first. More let a prompt that diverges mid-history resume closer to the divergence. |
| `--cache-disk-prefix-step N` | 4096 | spacing of the shared system-prompt entries; 0 disables them. |
| `--cache-disk-min-tokens N` | 2048 | shorter prompts (keep-alive pings, title requests) are never written. |

Each flag also reads `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_DISK[_...]` from the environment.

- **The cache directory must not be NTFS-compressed** (fix with
  `compact /U /S:<dir>`): compression caps an NVMe at ~140 MB/s, against
  ~1.4 GB/s without (a 1.8 GB entry saves in 1.3 s and restores in 0.8 s).
- **Age-based cleanup of the directory is safe.** The server refreshes a
  file's timestamp whenever it uses it.
- **Make the agent rewrite history as little as possible.** Every rewrite is a
  cache break: set its compaction trigger well below the context size.
  Auxiliary calls (titles, summaries, vision) take the slot too; the cache
  makes that cheap, not free.

## Decision classifier

`POST /v1/classifier` answers typed `choice`, `noul` (yes/no) and `score`
questions about a text with calibrated probabilities instead of generated
text, from an open decision model such as StartLux-Decision. Start a server
with that model and `--classifier-config`, or run it as a child of a router
(`--models-preset`) next to the big model: one port, one API key, both models.
On the CPU (`-dev none -ngl 0`) StartLux-Decision-2B BF16 answers a yes/no
question in 0.4 s. Details: [docs/classifier.md](docs/classifier.md).

# ROCmFPX llama.cpp

This public downstream tracks current upstream `llama.cpp` while
developing the ROCmFPX weight-format family for AMD GPUs. Normal Vulkan support
remains enabled; HIP and CPU are also supported build targets. Existing NVFP4
GGUF tensors can be loaded natively and remain bit-exact when an NVFP4 model is
completed with the `NVFP4` quantization preset.

Carlo Pasquale (Charlie12345) is the creator and founder of the ROCmFPX format
family and of ROCmFP3, ROCmFP4, ROCmFP6, and ROCmFP8. See
[ROCmFPX documentation](docs/rocmfpx/README.md), [NOTICE](NOTICE), and the
same upstream [MIT license terms](LICENSE) with the ROCmFPX copyright line.

## Contributors and history

ROCmFPX preserves the upstream `llama.cpp` lineage and the public legacy
ROCmFPX lineage. Original commit authors and commit IDs remain reachable. The
legacy lineage is connected by an ancestry-only merge whose source tree is
identical to the current ROCmFPX tree, so legacy code does not replace the
current implementation.

- [Current ROCmFPX contributors](https://github.com/ROCmFPX/ROCmFPX/graphs/contributors)
- [Legacy ROCmFPX contributors](https://github.com/charlie12345/ROCmFPX/graphs/contributors)
- [Upstream llama.cpp contributors](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/graphs/contributors)

GitHub contributor displays can lag behind repository history. The complete
commit-level author record is also available with `git shortlog -sne main`.

The currently qualified formats are experimental. The on-disk layouts of
ROCmFP2/3/4/6/8 are frozen for compatibility; new kernel and quantizer work
must preserve their encoded sizes and semantics.

### ROCmFP2 tensor type identity

Canonical dual-scale S40 ROCmFP2 uses GGUF tensor type **111**. Its payload is
still exactly 10 bytes per 32 weights (2.5 bpw); only the tensor type tag moved.
Legacy type 107 is reserved as ambiguous because both dual-scale S40 and an
affine `code * scale - offset` layout were emitted with that same ID and block
size. ROCmFPX refuses type 107 instead of guessing and silently corrupting a
model.

New quantizations write type 111 automatically. To audit an older file, run:

```bash
scripts/rocmfpx/retag-legacy-rocmfp2.py MODEL.gguf
```

Only when the file's provenance confirms that it uses dual-scale S40, make a
backup and retag its tensor headers in place:

```bash
scripts/rocmfpx/retag-legacy-rocmfp2.py MODEL.gguf \
  --layout s40-dual-scale-v1 --apply
```

The tool does not inspect or infer the layout because the two interpretations
cannot be distinguished from the bytes. Do not use it on affine ROCmFP2 files.

## Optional Charlie Vulkan plugin

The optional [`ROCmFPXVulkan` extension](extensions/rocmfpx-vulkan/README.md)
preserves the proven Charlie-era ROCmFP4 Vulkan path as a separate backend. It
does not replace or patch llama.cpp's normal `Vulkan0` backend. The extension
is disabled by default and appears as `ROCmFPXVulkan0` only when it is built
and explicitly loaded.

Build both the normal Vulkan backend and the optional extension on Linux:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-rocmfpx-vulkan -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
  -DGGML_VULKAN=ON \
  -DROCMFPX_VULKAN_PLUGIN=ON
cmake --build build-rocmfpx-vulkan \
  --target llama-cli rocmfpx-vulkan-plugin -j
```

Load the plugin and select its device:

```bash
export ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_PATH="$PWD/build-rocmfpx-vulkan/bin/rocmfpx-vulkan-plugin.so"
build-rocmfpx-vulkan/bin/llama-cli --list-devices
build-rocmfpx-vulkan/bin/llama-cli \
  -m /absolute/path/to/model.gguf \
  -dev ROCmFPXVulkan0 -ngl 999
```

Keep `rocmfpx-vulkan-plugin.so` and its sibling
`libggml-rocmfpx-vulkan.so` together. Both files must come from the same build
and ROCmFPX commit. `--list-devices` should show both `Vulkan0` and
`ROCmFPXVulkan0`; remove `ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_PATH` to return to the normal backend.
See the [extension guide](extensions/rocmfpx-vulkan/README.md) for matched
ROCmFP4 benchmarks and qualification limits.

## Plugin system

ROCmFPX plugin ABI v1 lets trusted native shared libraries register a standard
ggml backend or receive model-open and model-close notifications for PLE, KV
checkpoint, repack-cache, and expert-streaming sidecars. Set
`ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_PATH` to a plugin file or directory before starting a ROCmFPX
tool. Use `:` between entries on Linux and macOS and `;` on Windows. Directories
are scanned once, non-recursively, in sorted order; the working directory is
never searched automatically.

A minimal C plugin looks like this:

```c
#define ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_BUILD
#include "rocmfpx-plugin.h"

static int on_load(void) {
    return 0;
}

static const struct rocmfpx_plugin_v1 plugin = {
    ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION,
    sizeof(struct rocmfpx_plugin_v1),
    "example-sidecar",
    "0.1.0",
    ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_CAP_SIDECAR,
    on_load,
    0,
    0,
    0,
};

ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_EXPORT const struct rocmfpx_plugin_v1 * rocmfpx_plugin_query(
        uint32_t host_abi_version,
        const struct rocmfpx_plugin_host_v1 * host) {
    if (host_abi_version != ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION || !host ||
        host->abi_version != ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION) {
        return 0;
    }
    return &plugin;
}
```

Build and load it on Linux:

```bash
cc -shared -fPIC -I/path/to/ROCmFPX/include \
  example-sidecar.c -o example-sidecar.so
ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_PATH="$PWD/example-sidecar.so" \
  /path/to/ROCmFPX/build/bin/llama-cli --list-devices
```

Every plugin must export `rocmfpx_plugin_query`, validate the ABI, return a
static size-versioned descriptor, and keep that descriptor and its strings
alive until unload. A backend plugin copies `backend_load` and `plugin_path`
during the query, then registers its matching ggml backend from `on_load`. A
sidecar uses `on_model_open` and `on_model_close` and keys its state by
`model_id`. ABI v1 provides discovery, backend registration, and lifecycle
notifications; capability flags alone do not intercept tensors or token
generation. Plugins run as native code with the same permissions as ROCmFPX,
so load only libraries you trust. See the complete [plugin and sidecar ABI
guide](docs/rocmfpx/PLUGINS.md) and the tested
[`rocmfpx-test-plugin`](tests/rocmfpx-test-plugin.c) example.

## Windows AMD multi-GPU bridge

Windows users with two AMD GPUs can evaluate Charlie12345's external
[Windows AMD Multi-GPU Bridge](https://github.com/charlie12345/windows-amd-vllm-multigpu).
For ROCmFPX and llama.cpp, use its dedicated
[Windows installation guide](https://github.com/charlie12345/windows-amd-vllm-multigpu/blob/main/docs/install-llama-rocmfpx.md),
not the separate vLLM adapter instructions.

The bridge keeps the ROCmFPX source tree unchanged. It supplies an external
`roc::rccl` CMake package to the existing HIP collective interface, so build
ROCmFPX with `GGML_HIP_RCCL=ON`, point `rccl_DIR` at the installed bridge, and
use the bridge's `run-with-llama-plugin.ps1` launcher. The tested Windows path
also requires `GGML_CUDA_NO_PEER_COPY=ON`; follow the external guide for the
matching ROCm version, GPU target, DLL layout, health probes, and model-specific
launch flags.

Despite the launcher's name, this transport is **not** loaded through
`ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_PATH` and is not a ROCmFPX ABI v1 plugin. ABI v1 can register a
ggml backend or receive model lifecycle notifications, but it cannot inject a
link-time RCCL provider or intercept collectives. Pointing
`ROCMFPX_PLUGIN_PATH` at `rccl.dll` will therefore do nothing. The current
external-package design is the upstream-safe integration: update ROCmFPX
normally, then configure a fresh HIP build against the bridge package.

The bridge is experimental, source-only, and currently qualified only on the
hardware and revisions listed by its maintainers. Validate its small parity
and transport probes before loading a large model; a selectable GPU target is
not the same as a runtime-qualified configuration.

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM (and VLM) inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on
a wide range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is build on top of the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.
